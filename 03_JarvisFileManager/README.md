## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Components

- **`main.py`** - Application entry point
- **`ui.py`** - Tkinter-based desktop UI with status indicators
- **`voice.py`** - Speech recognition and text-to-speech handling
- **`agent.py`** - OpenAI integration and command processing

### Key Technologies

- **Speech Recognition:** Google Speech API via `SpeechRecognition`
- **Text-to-Speech:** `pyttsx3` for voice feedback
- **AI Processing:** OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo for command interpretation
- **System Integration:** Python `os`, `subprocess`, and `pathlib`
- **UI Framework:** Tkinter for desktop application

### Intelligent Features

- **App Indexing:** Automatically discovers installed applications from Start Menu
- **Fuzzy Matching:** Intelligently matches spoken names to actual apps/folders
- **Context Awareness:** Maintains current directory state
- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallbacks and user feedback

## üé® User Interface

The application opens as a desktop window with:

- **Status Indicator:** Shows current state (Listening, Processing, Ready)
- **Last Command Display:** Shows your most recent voice command
- **Color-coded Feedback:** 
  - Blue: Listening for voice input
  - Orange: Processing with AI
  - Green: Success
  - Red: Error

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (required)

### Supported Applications
The agent can open/close any application found in your Start Menu, including:
- Notepad, Chrome, Firefox, Edge
- Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Sublime Text
- Microsoft Office applications
- Windows built-in apps (Camera, Calculator, etc.)

### Supported Folders
- Desktop, Downloads, Documents
- Pictures, Music, Videos
- Any folder accessible from your user directory

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No module named 'pyaudio'"**
```bash
# Install PyAudio using pipwin (recommended for Windows)
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
```

**"OpenAI API key not found"**
- Ensure your `.env` file exists with the correct API key
- Check that `python-dotenv` is installed

**"Speech not recognized"**
- Check microphone permissions
- Ensure clear speech and minimal background noise
- Try speaking more slowly or clearly

**"App not found"**
- The app must be installed and have a Start Menu shortcut
- Try using the exact app name or a close variation

### Performance Tips

- **Clear speech:** Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- **Quiet environment:** Minimize background noise
- **Specific commands:** Be specific about what you want to do
- **Wait for feedback:** Let the agent complete each action before giving the next command

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Potential features for future versions:
- **File search and content reading**
- **System monitoring and alerts**
- **Automated workflows and scripting**
- **Integration with cloud storage**
- **Advanced natural language processing**
- **Custom voice commands and macros**
