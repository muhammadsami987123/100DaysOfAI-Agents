## Financial Summary
At 30 years old, you have a great opportunity to start investing for retirement. With a monthly income of $2,500 and a medium risk tolerance, it's important to build a balanced portfolio that can grow over time while managing potential risks.

## Investment Plan
To work towards your retirement goal, consider allocating a portion of your monthly income towards investments. A suggested savings rate could be around 15% of your income, which would be $375 per month. This will allow you to gradually build your retirement fund. 

## Diversification Strategy
A diversified investment portfolio can help reduce risk while allowing for growth. Hereâ€™s a simple allocation strategy based on your medium risk tolerance:

- **Stocks (Equities)**: 60%
  - Focus on a mix of large-cap, mid-cap, and international stocks for growth potential.
  
- **Bonds (Fixed Income)**: 30%
  - Include a mix of government and corporate bonds to provide stability.
  
- **Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)**: 10%
  - These can provide exposure to real estate markets without needing to own physical properties.

## Recommendations
1. **Start Saving**: Aim to set aside $375 each month. Automate your savings to make it easier.
2. **Open an Investment Account**: Choose a brokerage that offers low fees and a user-friendly platform.
3. **Invest in Index Funds or ETFs**: These funds provide instant diversification and are usually lower in cost compared to actively managed funds.
4. **Review Annually**: Reassess your investment strategy and adjust your allocation based on performance and changes in your financial situation.
