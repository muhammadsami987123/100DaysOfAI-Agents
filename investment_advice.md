## Financial Summary
At 29 years old with an income of $1,500 per month, you're in a great position to start planning for retirement. With a medium risk tolerance, you can balance growth potential with some stability in your investment strategy. 

## Investment Plan
To prepare for retirement, it's advisable to save a percentage of your income regularly. Given your medium risk profile, a balanced approach will help grow your savings while managing potential losses.

### Suggested Savings Rate
- Aim to save around 15% of your income monthly. This equates to $225 per month.

### Investment Horizon
- With retirement likely several decades away, you have time to ride out market fluctuations.

## Diversification Strategy
Diversifying your investments can reduce risk. A simple allocation plan might include:

- **Stocks (50%)**: Focus on a mix of U.S. and international stocks for growth.
- **Bonds (30%)**: Invest in a mix of government and corporate bonds for stability.
- **Real Estate (10%)**: Consider a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) for exposure to property markets.
- **Cash or Cash Equivalents (10%)**: Keep a small portion in savings or money market accounts for liquidity.

## Recommendations
1. **Open a Retirement Account**: Consider an IRA or 401(k) to take advantage of tax benefits.
2. **Automate Savings**: Set up automatic transfers to your investment accounts to ensure you save consistently.
3. **Review Regularly**: Check your investment performance annually and adjust your allocations as needed.
