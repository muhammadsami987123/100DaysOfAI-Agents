## 🚀 Let’s Build the Future – One Agent at a Time

This challenge is part of my long-term dream to build a fully offline, autonomous AI assistant that understands and acts on natural language — no cloud required. Follow my journey and feel free to contribute, collaborate, or get inspired.

### Day 07 – YouTube InsightFetcher

**Description**  
Enter a YouTube video URL, and the agent fetches its transcript and distills it into:
- Actionable takeaways  
- Memorable quotes  
- Key data/statistics

**Usage**  
```python
insight = youtube_insight_fetcher("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exampleID", openai_api_key)
print(insight)
```

**Output**
```
**Actionable Takeaways**
* Practice active recall after watching…
* Use spaced repetition for concept retention…
* Apply this mindset by setting “daily reflection” points…

**“Memorable Quotes”**
> “The best way to learn is to teach.”
> “Consistency beats intensity.”

**Key Stats**
* 80% of learners improved retention by…
* Studied for only 10 minutes/day led to…
```
